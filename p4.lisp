;; Problem 4
;; 16 November 2001

;; A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
;; made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

;; Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

;; Answer:
;; 	906609


;; the wrong thing to do is start small and work your way up

(defun p4 ()
  (let ((m 0))
    (do ((i 100 (1+ i)))
	((eql i 1000))
      (do ((j 100 (1+ j)))
	  ((eql j 1000))
	(if (palindrome (* i j))
	    (if (> (* i j) m)
		(setf m (* i j))))))
    m))



;; the right thing to do is start at the top and descend
;; until you find a palindrome (this is trickier)

(defun digits (n &optional (lst ()))
  "break an integer into a list of its digits"

      (if (equal (the fixnum (first lst)) (the fixnum (car (last lst))))
	  (palindrome-list (subseq lst 1 (- (length lst) 1)))
