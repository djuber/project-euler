This is some project euler code I have worked on, and a first foray for me into using github. Some code is snipped from the discussion forums 
(this is how I learned to stop writing like Hal Abelson and love the loop macro). 
Some pieces in CL, some in Python, early portions in C.

Typically, my original method will not have a letter appended. So
p10.lisp is something I wrote, while p12a.lisp is something I read in the forum.
