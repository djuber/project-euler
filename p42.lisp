Problem 42
25 April 2003

The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

(defun sum-for-word (string)
  (reduce #'+ (mapcar #'1+ (to-numbers string))))

(defun triangle-p (n)
  "is n triangular?"
  (do* ((i 1 (1+ i))
	(sum i (+ sum i)))
       ((or (= n sum) (> sum n))
	(if (= n sum) t nil))))

(defun slurp-strings ()
  (with-open-file (stream "~/src/project-euler/words.txt") 
    (let ((result nil))
      (until (string-equal (first result) "YOURSELF")  ; need to learn to deal with eof
	(push (first (read-delimited-list #\, stream)) result))
      (push "YOUTH" result))))

(defun count-triangular-words ()
  (loop for i in (slurp-strings)
     when (triangle-p (sum-for-word i))
       count i))

(defun p42 ()
  (count-triangular-words))
