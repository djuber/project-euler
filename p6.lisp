;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; 1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385

;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025

;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
;; numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
;; natural numbers and the square of the sum.
