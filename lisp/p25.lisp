;; The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

;;     F_(n) = F_(nâˆ’1) + F_(nâˆ’2), where F_(1) = 1 and F_(2) = 1.

;; Hence the first 12 terms will be:

;;     F_(1) = 1
;;     F_(2) = 1
;;     F_(3) = 2
;;     F_(4) = 3
;;     F_(5) = 5
;;     F_(6) = 8
;;     F_(7) = 13
;;     F_(8) = 21
;;     F_(9) = 34
;;     F_(10) = 55
;;     F_(11) = 89
;;     F_(12) = 144

;; The 12th term, F_(12), is the first term to contain three digits.

;; What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
